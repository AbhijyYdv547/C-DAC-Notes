## Day-6 
### Conditions and Imports
1. Write a python program which accept two numbers and print max and min between them
2. Write a python program which accept three numbers and print max and min between them
3. Write a python program which accept a number, if the number is divided by 3 then console print 'fizz', if the number is divided by 5 console will print 'buzz' and if the number is divided by both then it will print 'fizzbuzz' also if it not divided by 3 or 5 print number as it is 
4. Write a python program find the given character is an uppercase letter or lowercase letter or a digit or a special character.
5. Write a python program to display current date and time on console(using import)

## Day-7
### loops
1.Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9. 
- Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit. 
---
2. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.
- Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
- 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
- Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
- Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
---
3. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
---
4. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and print the numbers that are divisible by 5 in a comma separated sequence. 
- Sample Data : 0100,0011,1010,1001,1100,1001
- Expected Output : 1010
---
5.Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters. 
- Sample Data : Python 3.2
- Expected Output :
Letters 6
Digits 2
