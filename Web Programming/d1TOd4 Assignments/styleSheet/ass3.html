  <div class="centered">Whatever you’re sulking about, forget it. The job interview that didn’t go well, or the relationship that didn’t work was bound to happen and it happened. Everything happens for a reason. There is a reason you’re going through a bad phase and there is a reason you might be basking in glory - it’s a cycle and you need to quietly accept it. You need not worry about the future, nor should you pay attention to the past. You only have control over the present, so live it to the fullest.</div>
