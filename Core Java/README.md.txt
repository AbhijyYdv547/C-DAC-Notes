# Core Java-Day 1 
## Features:-
### Simple
### Platform Independent 
### High Performance
### Java is 100% object oriented everything is in class in c++ you can write main outside classs.
### java is compiled and intrepeted language.
### JIT(Just in Time) Compilier:-
	>work just before execuation.
	>It conver some part of code directly into machine understanding.
	>because of this language become faster it avoid read and convert time.

### Security over the internet 
### Robust(strong/tough)
	>Automatic Memory Management
	>Expection Handelling
### Multithearding(multitasking)
### Distributed(Remote Server involved) 
### Dynamic
***
## First Program
### JDK/JRE
	![JDK/JRE](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/Media/2_jdkjre.png) 
```JAVA
	public class Hello
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			System.out.println("Hello world");
		}
	}

```

### When the class is decleared as public then the name of program should be class name..
### static method can called without object creation thats why used in main.
###`out` is the object called for print, `out` object is accessible using System class.
### `println()` is a method.
### At least one class should be public because of `main()`.
### Class name always should be start with capital.
### System=Class, out=object, println()=function.
### Setting path of java/javac
	>for setting epath of java and javac you need following steps
	![setpath of java/javac](https://github.com/shreeshailaya/c-dac/Media/1_setpath.png)
### for run program javac _programName_.
### javac -version is used to check the version of java.
### Bytes code(.class) always based on class name.
